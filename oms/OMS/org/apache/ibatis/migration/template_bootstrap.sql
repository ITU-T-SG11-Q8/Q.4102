--// Bootstrap.sql

-- This is the only SQL script file that is NOT
-- a valid migration and will not be run or tracked
-- in the changelog.  There is no @UNDO section.

--// Do I need this file?

-- New projects likely won't need this file.
-- Existing projects will likely need this file.
-- It's unlikely that this bootstrap should be run
-- in the production environment.

--// Purpose

-- The purpose of this file is to provide a facility
-- to initialize the database to a state before MyBatis
-- SQL migrations were applied.  If you already have
-- a database in production, then you probably have
-- a script that you run on your developer machine
-- to initialize the database.  That script can now
-- be put in this bootstrap file (but does not have
-- to be if you are comfortable with your current process.

--// Running

-- The bootstrap SQL is run with the "migrate bootstrap"
-- command.  It must be run manually, it's never run as
-- part of the regular migration process and will never
-- be undone. Variables (e.g. ${variable}) are still
-- parsed in the bootstrap SQL.

-- After the boostrap SQL has been run, you can then
-- use the migrations and the changelog for all future
-- database change management.
